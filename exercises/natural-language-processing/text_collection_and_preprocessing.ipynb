    "# Text Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "You should collect and preprocess some textual data to investigate what is `Gisma` and how people perceive this brand on social media. In particular, you should do the following:\n",
    "- Request and receive the [About Gisma](https://www.gisma.com/school/about-us) web page using [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "- Extract and clean up the main content of this web page using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).\n",
    "- Go to [Reddit's App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) to create a new Reddit application. Once the `script` application is created, note down the `client ID`, `client secret`, and `user agent`.\n",
    "- Build a client application to work with the Reddit API using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/quick_start.html).\n",
    "- Search for the latest posts about `Gisma` on Reddit and clean up their content.\n",
    "- Considering these collected textual data from two different sources (Gisma's website and Reddit), what can you say about this brand?"
